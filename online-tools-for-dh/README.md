# Online Tools for DH - Workshop

## Out(side) the Box - Online tools for DH

What do you do when your personal computer is no longer sufficient for your research needs? Do you need to run that web scrape for months at a time? Some DH tools are only available as web based services, and many run well when self hosted in cloud resources. In this workshop we will look at some web only tools, as well as how to host your own in the cloud. After a quick introduction to some tools and resources, we will work through a couple of examples, one web scrape and visualization, and one text analysis.
